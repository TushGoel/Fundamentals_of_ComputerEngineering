Solve the following problems independently for accomplishing the Task-1:

1.) Implement and test two functions: SwapP and SwapR. 
- SwapP swaps the values of two integer variables using pass‐by‐pointer. 
- SwapR swaps the values of two integer variables using pass‐by‐reference.

2. ) Modify the C++ program to swap the p1 and p2 pointers to point to each other’s values.

3.) Write a program that starts by asking a teacher for the size of his class (the number of students). Then the program asks the teacher to enter for each student his/her name along with his/her grade in an exam. All grades are integers that have to be in the range from 0 to 100 (inclusive). Store the names in an array of strings and the grades in another array of integers. Use dynamic memory to create both arrays. Define a function that implements the sorting algorithm INSERTION‐SORT(A,n) as explained in class. Call this function to sort the above arrays in a descending order of the students’ grades in the exam. Your program will display the sorted list of students’ names along with their grades.
