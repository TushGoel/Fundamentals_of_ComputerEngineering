Task - 6:

1.)  Write a C++ program to utilize the Standard Template Library (STL) and the STL Algorithms to carry out the following tasks:
a. Define a vector that is initialized with ten integers: {14, 18, 6, 16, 8, 20, 4, 10, 12, 2}.
b. Define a list, a stack, and a priority_queue, each initialized as a copy of the vector.
c. Increase the value of each element in the vector by 40.
d. Increase the value of each element in the list by 30.
e. Increase the value of each element in the stack by 20.
f. Increase the value of each element in the priority_queue by 10.
g. Check if the vector contains the value 44 and if so, find its location.
h. Find the location of the first element in the vector that is greater than 50.
i. Determine whether all of the elements in the vector are greater than 45.
j. Print on the screen the results of each one of the above tasks.


2.) Write a C++ program to compare the Recursive implementation of the Rod Cutting problem with the Dynamic Programming implementation of the same problem. The comparison should be in terms of each implementation running time for rod sizes: 5, 10, 15, …… , 40, 45, and 50 inches.
a. Use the C++ clock function to measure the time consumed by each implementation in micro‐seconds. (Reference: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/clock/)
b. Use the following formula to calculate the price of each cut of length L inches: 2 if L = 1 Price = floor(L*2.5) if 1 < L < rod size (L*2.5)‐1 if L = rod size where floor is a C++ function that returns the largest integral value that is not greater than the value of its parameter.
